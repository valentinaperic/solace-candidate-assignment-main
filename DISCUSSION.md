# Discussion and Future Improvements

## Search Enhancements  
Currently, the search supports matching multiple terms by splitting the input and requiring *all* terms to match somewhere in the advocateâ€™s data fields.  

In the future, we could improve this by adding:  
- **Partial matching and fuzzy search** to handle typos or partial inputs better.  
- **Search ranking/relevance sorting** so results most relevant to the query appear first.  
- **Highlighting matched terms** in the results for better UX.

## Performance  
With larger data sets, filtering on the client side might become slow. Implementing **server-side search** or **pagination** would improve scalability.  

## UI/UX Improvements  
- Add a **clear (X) button** inside the search input for easier reset.  
- Make the table **responsive with horizontal scrolling or collapsing columns** on small screens.  
- Provide **loading and error states** during data fetch.  
- Add **accessibility improvements**, including ARIA roles for the table and input controls.

## Code Quality  
- Introduce **unit tests** for search logic and components.
